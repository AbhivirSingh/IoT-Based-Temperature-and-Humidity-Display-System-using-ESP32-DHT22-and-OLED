# IoT-Based Temperature and Humidity Display System using ESP32, DHT22 and OLED

This project demonstrates a simple IoT system that monitors and displays temperature and humidity values using an **ESP32 microcontroller**, **DHT22 sensor**, and an **OLED (SSD1306) display**. It is a great entry-level embedded system project to learn real-time data acquisition, sensor interfacing, and display communication using **MicroPython**.
